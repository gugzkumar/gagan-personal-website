  "body": "## Architecture\n\n![](/images/cra_netlify_arch.png)\n\n* Github as acts as the repository and version control tool for all our code\n* Netlify hosts the static Web Assets and makes your Application publicly accessible. The following are hosted:\n  * Main webpage (includes Landing Page and Blogs) is written in React\n  * Web page embedded with Netlify CMS UI is hosted\n* Netlify Identity is used so the owner of the application can login and use the Netlify CMS securely\n* Netlify Functions is a feature that makes it easy for you to set up JS functions that can be triggered by an API request\n* When the user makes changes/adds new application content via CMS, Netlify publishes those changes directly to Github *(this is important, since traditionally CMS' save data to a database, but here Netlify saves the data within source control)*\n\n## G﻿etting Started\n\nHere's how you can set up and use this Application for your self\n\n### Step 01: Copy Repo to Github\n\nClone or fork <https://github.com/gugzkumar/create-react-app-with-netlify-cms>\n\n### Step 02: Create a Netlify Account\n\nCreate an account in [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) if you don’t have one\n\n### Step 03: Set up your site in Netlify\n\nFollow the instructions in <https://docs.netlify.com/welcome/add-new-site/> for importing from an existing repository. Use your github repository from step 1.\n\nFor build settings you can use the following:\n\n* Base directory: root of the project (you can leave this blank)\n* Build command: `npm run build`\n* Publish directory: `build`\n\nFrom here, feel free to choose your own domain, and secure the website with https.\n\n### Step 04: Set up Netlify Identity\n\nOnce your site is up and running, go to you site settings and enable Netlify Identity. Then scroll all the way down and enable git gateway. \n\n![](/images/netlify_identity.png)\n\nGot to https://\\[your_website_name].netlify.app/admin sign up for account. Confirm it. Now you can log in and use the Netlify CMS. Try adding a new blog.\n\n![](/images/netlify_cms_signup.png)\n\nFinally go and disable sign ups for your website in the Netlify Identity settings.\n\n## Using and Adding New Features\n\n### Folder Structure\n\n```\n├── cmsContent/\n│   └── blogs/\n│       ├── *.json\n├── netlify/\n│   └── functions/\n│       └── *.js\n├── public/\n│   ├── admin/\n│   │   ├── config.yml\n│   │   └── index.html\n│   ├── content/\n│   ├── images/\n│       └── *.js\n│   ├── _redirects\n│   └── index.html\n├── src/\n│   ├── cmsConfigs/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── Footer/\n│   │   └── Header/\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Blogs/\n│   │   └── Landing/\n│   ├── styles/\n│   │   ├── Button.js\n│   │   ├── consts.js\n│   │   └── theme.js\n│   ├── App.js\n│   └── index.js\n├── buildCMSContent.js\n├── netlify.toml\n└── package.json\n```\n\nIf you are familiar with [Create a React App](<https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app>), then a lot of the files should be familiar to you. I suggest you do read its documentation, since it can help you with this app too. I won't describe the purpose of ever file and folder, just the one's I think are important to know and may not get covered in Create a React App.\n\n- **cmsContent/:** where CMS content is saved\n- **netlify/functions/:** houses JS Functions hosted by netlify functions\n- **public/:** hosts static assets\n- **public/admin/config.yml:** Netlify CMS' configuration file\n- **public/content/:** build directory for all CMS content\n- **public/images/:** where CMS images are saved\n- **src/:** source code for react app\n- **src/cmsConfigs/:** where CMS content meta information is preprocessed and saved so it can be used by react\n- **src/components/:** where dumb/shareable React components are saved\n- **src/pages/:** where Page specific components are saved\n- **src/styles/:** universal style configurations and constants\n- **src/App.js:** main React component that acts as the root of the project\n- **buildCMSContent.js:** helper script that moves content from `cmsContent` into the `public/content` folder, and creates \n- **netlify.toml:** netlfy's configuration file\n- **package.json:** node's package manager configuration\n\n### Running Locally\n\n* Having node is installed is pre-requisite for running the app locally\n* Install the netlify cli `npm install netlify-cli -g`\n* Install all dependencies: `npm install`\n* Run `node buildCMSContent.js` to build the CMS content locally so you can see them during local development\n* Run `netlify dev`\n* The application is now hosted statically on <http://localhost:8888>\n\n**Important:** If new content has been added via CMS, rerun `node buildCMSContent.js` to see the latest content locally.\n\n### Adding a new blog\n\nLog in to https://\\[your_website_name].netlify.app/admin and use the CMS to add a new blog.\n\n### Adding a new collection for the CMS\n\nTo add a new collection for your CMS (Blogs collection is setup by default), add to the configuration file in `public/admin/config.yml`. Read Netlify's Documentation for more guidance:\n\n- <https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options/#collections>\n- <https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/collection-types/>\n\nMake sure the `folder` field value is `\"cmsContent/<name>\"` where `<name>` is the value of the `<name>` field\n\n### Styling\n\nThe application is setup to use [Chakra UI](<https://chakra-ui.com/>) and [@emotion/styled](<https://emotion.sh/docs/styled>) to handle styling. You can update and variants for Chakra UI components by updating the files in `src/styles/`. This will keep the theming of our Web App more consistent. Read for more info:\n\n- <https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/customize-theme>\n- <https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/component-style>\n\n### Functions\n\nNetlify has a nifty feature called [Neltify Functions](<https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/>). This allows you to host JS functions that can be triggered by and HTTPS request. We have one setup for you out of the box in `netlify/functions`. Try it out by visiting the following URL in your browser: `https://[your_website_name].app/.netlify/functions/hello`\n\nIf you want to add a new function, just add a javascript file to the `netlify/functions/` folder, and the endpoint will be `https://[your_website_name].app/.netlify/functions/<file_name>`."
